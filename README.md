# Open-Cyber-Lab
An interactive, open-source cybersecurity lab environment for learning, testing, and practicing cybersecurity skills.
This project involves creating a virtual network using free and open-source tools for cybersecurity testing, log collection, SIEM integration, threat intelligence, and incident response. 
# Cybersecurity Project

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a virtual network using free and open-source tools for cybersecurity testing, log collection, SIEM integration, threat intelligence, and incident response. The final project will be uploaded to GitHub as a repository for others to learn and replicate.

## Project Objectives
1. Build a virtual network for hands-on cybersecurity testing.
2. Perform vulnerability scans, penetration tests, network scans, and port scans.
3. Collect logs and integrate them with a SIEM tool.
4. Incorporate threat intelligence for enhanced detection.
5. Develop an incident response procedure.
6. Use open-source tools to ensure accessibility.
